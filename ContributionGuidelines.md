# Contribution Guidelines

## Documentation
Documentation for subcomponent such as frontend, simulator, ... is kept in the corresponding repository. High level documentation belongs to the `ETH Mike Documentation` repository.

Documentation in [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is encouraged, as this allows to link to parts in the code or the rest of the documenation. Keeping the documentation as part of the repository allows for easy version control and assists in keeping documentation in sync with the code.

For sharing the documentation with a third party, the Markdown format can be converted to pdf file. Gitlab does not offer a direct version to a pdf at the moment. An external tool is needed for this. See [here](HowToConvertMarkdownToPdf.md) for more instructions.
